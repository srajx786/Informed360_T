Informed360 Layout Documentation

This file serves as a source‑of‑truth for the UI/UX of the
Informed360 news sentiment website. It does not render anything on the
server, but documents the high‑level design decisions so that both
designers and developers understand the structure of the site.

Sections:
  • Top bar: sticky header with the brand on the left and a live
    market ticker on the right. The ticker displays Sensex (BSE),
    Nifty (NSE) and NYSE Composite values with price and
    percentage change (green for positive, red for negative). It
    updates whenever the /api/ticker endpoint refreshes.

  • Main grid: three columns on desktop, collapsing to a single
    column on mobile. The left column holds up to three pinned
    articles (either manually pinned in rss-feeds.json or defaulted
    to the latest stories). The center column contains a hero
    carousel of four top stories with a slider, followed by a
    "Top News" panel that clusters stories by topic and shows
    sentiment bars and article counts. The right column lists
    trending topics with aggregated sentiment, and a "Daily News"
    list of the next few stories with thumbnails.

  • Sentiment bars: Each article or topic displays a compact bar
    divided into green (positive), grey (neutral) and black (negative)
    segments. Percentages for positive and negative sentiment appear
    below the bar. If the negative component exceeds 50%, a tooltip
    appears on hover showing the top negative terms VADER detected.

Everything on the site is live; no content is hardcoded. The
Express server fetches RSS feeds and market data on a schedule
and calculates sentiment on the fly.
